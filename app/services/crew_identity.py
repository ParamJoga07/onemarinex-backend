"""Identity rules for adding a person to a vessel call.

Passport numbers in historical data differ in case and whitespace, while an
HPID may differ because older HPIDs included the person's port and nationality.
Neither difference should create another manifest row.  Conversely, a passport
shared by several profiles is not safe evidence for choosing one account.

These helpers deliberately refuse ambiguous matches.  They never merge crew
profiles or guess which account owns a passport; that requires an audited
identity-reconciliation decision.
