"""Average shore leave duration, and which day a trip belongs to.

Two defects motivated these tests.

The average summed cab minutes only, then divided by a headcount that also
included crew who walked out on a shore pass without booking a cab. Those people
sat in the denominator and contributed nothing to the numerator, so any day
mixing the two read low.

Separately, trips were selected by `created_at` while shore passes were selected
by `out_time`. The two disagreed across midnight: a cab booked at 23:50 and
driven after midnight was reported on the day it was booked.

Runs against the configured database inside a transaction that is always rolled
back, so it leaves no rows behind.
